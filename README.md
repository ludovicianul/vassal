# vassal

Vassal is a simple security-free server that allows you to execute commands on a remote host. It's not meant to be something similar to vnc, rdp, ssh or others. Just see it as it is: a vassal ready to execute your orders. It can press keys, type strings, open files&URLs or execute shell commands.
